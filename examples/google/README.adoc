Pick cloud project to use:
 [1] cdb-aia-leaf1000999999
 [2] Create a new project
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list
item):  1

Your current project has been set to: [cdb-aia-leaf1000999999].

Not setting default zone/region (this feature makes it easier to use
[gcloud compute] by setting an appropriate default value for the
--zone and --region flag).
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute section on how to set
default compute region and zone manually. If you would like [gcloud init] to be
able to do this for you the next time you run it, make sure the
Compute Engine API is enabled for your project on the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis page.

Created a default .boto configuration file at [/home/kmutch/.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use karl.mutch@cognizant.com by default
* Commands will reference project `cdb-aia-leaf1000999999` by default
Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the SDK like arg files and output formatting

== RabbitMQ on Google Cloud

The RabbitMQ component of a runner deployment is typically a stable component that can be deployed using a Virtual Machine.  The easiest way to deploy this style of component is via the Google Marketplace distribution of the bitnami packaged RabbitMQ non clustered version and the Google click to deploy option.
