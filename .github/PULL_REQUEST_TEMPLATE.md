**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first.**

*Any change needs to be discussed before proceeding. Failure to do so may result in the rejection of the pull request.*

Your PR must have been done in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `bug/` or `feature/` prefixes, followed by the issue number. Good examples are: `bug/100-signin-issue` or `feature/125-issue-templates`.

The PR must contain only one commit, (if not squash them into a single commit).

<!--
Work-in-progress PRs are welcome as a way to get early feedback - just prefix
the title with [WIP].

Add the change in the changelog (except for test changes and docs updates).
Please edit CHANGELOG.md and add the change under the appropriate category (NEW
FEATURES, IMPROVEMENTS & BUG FIXES) along with the PR number.
